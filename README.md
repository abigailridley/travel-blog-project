### About
- This was a really ambitious project that kept me busy during my travels. I learnt a lot as I went and would probably build it completely differently now.
- I learned how to use slugs for dyanmic routing in React, coming to appreciate how spending longer on setting up reusable components according to DRY would save time in the future. 
- I made good head way with a backend, creating a working database to push and store my blog posts. 
- I had dreams of a likes and comments system, with user athentication. A pipe dream that was never realised but would love to implement.
