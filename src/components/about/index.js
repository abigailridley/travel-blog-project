<p>Hi welcome</p>
<p>
This is a project I started when we started travelling in February. I have been learning to code and also wanted a way to keep my family updated and anyone else who is interested. So I combined the two created this page. Dylan & I are currently travelling down the West Coast of the Americas. We are using Trusted Housesitters for the majority of our stays, so we get free accommodation in exchange for looking after pets.

I will be continually updating the site with more features as I try and teach myself new coding techniques. The site is made with React and hosted on Netlify. If you spot anything that looks weird or think anything could be improved in any way pls let me know.
