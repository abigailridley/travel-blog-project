                Today is day 159 of Big Trip. A couple of days ago we left the chaotic city of Bogotá for small town close to Medellín. Our stay in Bogotá revolved around reuniting with a friend from my year abroad that I met 9 years ago in Mexico, and hadn’t seen in 8 years. It was a slow domestic kind of couple of weeks, with its own unique challenges.

                We flew from Costa Rica to Bogotá and we were meeting my friend Cris at the airport. I was so nervous, like a first date but worse and weirder. We were staying with him, where he lives in a flat with his mum, his dad (sometimes), 6 rescue cats and a dog. The dog I had actually met before because when I visited him in Colombia 8 years ago, they had only just got the dog. The cats. Well. We have Pacho, Copetona, Mono, Copito, Pacha and Pelusa, all very special in their own unique ways. We didn’t actually do much in these 2 weeks, so you’ll see most of the pictures are with these remarkable creatures. I bonded with one called Copetona who had very clear attachment issues and liked to cry while you cuddled her. And the other favourite, actually the best cat, was Pacho, a beefy orange boy who liked to lie with his paws on your neck and breathe heavily into your ear.

                Two mad things that coincided with our stay in Bogotá were the Copa America final, and Colombian Independence Day. It was Colombia’s first time in the Copa America final against Argentina, the reigning champions. We went to a huge park in Bogotá to watch the game with a rowdy crowd on 3 big screens. Vuvuzelas, fireworks, colour smoke bombs, and general chaos. We watched the first half at the park and then 7 of us, included Cris’ abuela piled into a car to watch the rest from the flat. Where his mum had GRACIOUSLY made us traditional Colombian empanadas but all vegan, made with love just for us. Such a generous woman, making sure we were fed at all times as much as she could despite the despair at our vegan diets. Colombia lost but they’re not violent like the English so people were celebrating anyway.

                Nearer the end of our trip we had the pleasure of Colombian Independence Day. In true Latin American fashion, the parade was 2 hours late. And because the altitude is 2500m (!!!!!!) we all got burnt to a crisp which I am still suffering from now. I don’t wanna talk about the altitude but fucking hell I have to mention the altitude. Tried to go for a run one day cos we weren’t in a boiling hot place for once, but christ it was a test of my patience. The parade finally came and of course it was a military extravaganza. Literally every type of military sector was being paraded for us. Good bit of marching band action with drums, trumpets and something called a bell lyra according to ChatGPT. The sun is so strong at that altitude (drink every time I say altitude) we were dead for 2 days.

                We took a day trip to a ‘nearby’ town north of Bogotá that took 4 hours to get to, and 2 hours to get back from. We went to an interesting town called Guatavita, which was originally a Muiscan town, Muisca being the indigenous community from the centre of Colombia, and also my friend’s heritage which I hadn’t known. Guatavita was flooded to create a reservoir in the 1960s. All the residents were relocated to the ‘New Guatavita’ and the town was rebuilt to emulate the original architecture. And that’s the town that is a popular tourist destination now.

                Other than that we had a pretty low key time. We found a delicious veggie/vegan restaurant which was a pleasant surprise in a city full of chicken and chicharrón (crispy pig skin). There was a lovely lil botanical garden near my friend’s that only cost £1.50 to go in. Kew Gardens could never.

                After 2 weeks we said farewell to Cris, the 6 cats, 1 dog, his mum, and ww promised to not leave it 8 years this time. We got on a bus to head to Guatapé, an 8 hour bus journey which turned out to be a 10.5 hour bus journey through many mountains. Sufficiently painful and draining, but we find ourselves in the most amazing lil touristy town. Can’t wait to recover and tell you all about it. Our minds are now sufficiently blown from just booking our flights home. So after nearly 6 months, in only a couple weeks we will be on familiar terrain.
