   Okay so in the last blog post, we left off on what I would consider a relatively pivotal part of the trip. I’m cheating a bit, because we actually left GDL over a week ago, but I wanted Guadalajara to have its own blog post. I come to you from San Miguel de Allende. I’ll do a separate post on this little slice of life another time.

Right so imagine this, we get off the bus at Guadalajara, somewhere we were not expecting, on the side of a motorway. It is almost 40 degrees. And no, dry heat is not fucking better than humid heat??? What are these people on about??? My data isn’t working and we start off getting scammed by a taxi driver because I did not have the wherewithal to haggle properly. We arrive at the guesthouse in Guadalajara. No data still, so a lovely lady helps us contact the owner. This place is reminiscent of the places I used to rent, just one road over from somewhere I lived. Everything works, but only just about. The room has no aircon, only a broken fan. The next 3 days were so dramatic for me. I would wake up at 6am just to sit on the terrace while it was 20 degrees. We went to the cinema just for the aircon. FYI this story does have a happy ending. On day three of feeling like I couldn’t breathe, I found an airbnb nearby with aircon and convinced Dylan to go there that afternoon. We packed up, left the cockroach under a glass as a gift, slipped out of the place just as the owner was rounding the corner.

It really is wild how much aircon can change a girl’s day. After crying almost constantly for 3 days straight, we get let in EARLY to our new airbnb, walking past a lofted huge net where people are relaxing in fluffy pillows - I make a note to visit this net asap, and into our new aircon room - I immediately relax. SO after all that drama, we try to enjoy our remaining few days in GDL. We find some incredible vegan food. This little place where the guy is just throwing stuff in the airfryer in front of us. A vegan chinese place where a huge plate costs 85 pesos (~£4). The sweet and sour chicken turns out is roast potato??? An aesthethically pleasing vegan place where I had some delicious blue tacos and Dylan had a burrito with melted cheese on top.

We had a day trip to a nearby town Tlaquepaque. It’s a Pueblo Magico, a ‘magic town’ - I’m struggling to find a useful site to link to. But basically it’s a government tourist scheme in which towns (now 177) across Mexico are given Pueblo Magic status, due to their cultural significance, natural beauty, traditions, folklore, historical significance. The towns have guidelines to preserve the heritage and traditional architectural styles. So if there’s a Starbucks, the front of it looks just like the rest of the traditional buildings. Tlaquepaque is not a well known tourist spot but somewhere I used to go to with my pals back in the day. It was more beautiful than I remember, known for tequila and mariachi. We visited a cute little art gallery, and a beautiful ceramics museum.

This week left me WEAK so perfect timing for both of us to get ill. Luckily we had a long relaxing stay in San Miguel de Allende lined up. Another pueblo magic but certainly more touristy. I say this period was pivotal because having passed the 3 month mark, and we are both feeling fatigued of all the transitions, I was certainly wondering how on earth we would survive another 3 months of this. But we are feeling refreshed and have big plans for the coming weeks.
