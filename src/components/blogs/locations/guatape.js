<p>Our time in Spanish speaking countries is OVER which I am truly gutted about. But I am now fluent in Portuguese: Onde fica o banheiro? Rio de Janeiro will be our absolute last stop before returning to the UK. I do not know how to process that but for now let’s talk about our most recent stop in Guatapé, Colombia.</p>

               I didn’t really know what to expect for Guatapé, Dylan’s sort of friend had been there and it looked amazing from the pics. It is in the middle of the Colombian mountains. The journey there was ROUGH as we were just ascending and descending mountains for 10 hours but once we get there we decided it was absolutely worth it. Surrounded by green, full of lakes and palm trees and cacti, there is this colourful town, with every building painted with bright colours and decorative tiles called Zócalos on the lower part of the building. Guatapé is famous in Colombia for these Zócalos, they’re mostly flowers and sheep and guys with donkeys. And then just in the distance you have La Piedra del Peñol or El  Peñón de Guatapé: a huge rock with 708 steps. Our airbnb had this incredible view of the town and La Piedra with the lake surrounding it. It was so serene and idyllic, with the occasional person riding horseback passing below. Most of the pics are literally just this view at different angles and different times of day.

               The weather was pretty hot so we mostly just mooched around the streets looking at views and nice buildings. There were two vegan restaurants in town that we hit up interchangeably. The portions were insanely big and prices so cheap; we went to one place, Namaste, literally 3 times in 5 days.  It’s VERY touristy, especially on one particular street with umbrellas, people are taking selfies there at all hours of the day. To get around they have Tuk Tuks called Motochivas, beautifully painted with colourful designs. We indulged in one for our trip to the big rock. La Piedra probably only took 10 minutes to climb but our legs felt like jelly afterwards and I was sore for 2 days. The view from the top is incredible, lots of little islands with mountains in the distance.

               It was a really excellent penultimate stop on our travels. We spent time reflecting on our top faves and top worst places. It was mad to remember some of the iconic cities we’ve been to, as well as the dreamy isolated towns. I’m trying to keep an open mind for Rio, attempting to avert my instinctual desire for the perfect end to the nearly 6 month trip. We are staying 2 mins from Copacabana beach so I think it might be good as long as neither of us gets mugged? Only time will tell. Next blog post will be my last????? Thanks for coming along for the ride and see you after Rio de Janeiro. ☀️
