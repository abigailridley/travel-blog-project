            <p>Day 54 of Big Trip. I come to you from the upper deck of a double decker Amtrak train. Salinas, CA ➡️ Los Angeles, CA. 9 hours of train goodness. This is an early blog partly because I wanted to give Monterey its own spotlight and partly because we have 9 hours to kill and there’s only so much Drag Race UK vs The World season 2 I can take. (Not true, I watched S1 in one day it’s only cos my phone only downloaded the first 3 eps last night and we have no wifi.) Our stay in Monterey, specifically Pacific Grove, was a little slice of life. We managed to find a housesit in Pacific Grove which is right next to Monterey Bay. I had scoped out Monterey specifically to fulfil my lifelong dreams of seeing whales and dolphins in the wild. Pacific Grove itself was gorgeous, a calming and quant place with deer literally just roaming around the place eating the grass in people’s front gardens??

            When I was a wee one I had an obsession with dolphins. My bedroom was painted as an underwater theme; I had dolphin trinkets lining my shelves; I had a temporary tattoo stamp that I thought was so precious I never used it and it dried out (and now I have an actual tattoo of a whale tail); I wrote a year 3 project about bottlenose dolphins; I had an adopted dolphin called Rainbow from the WDCS and had the t-shirt to prove it. And the word ‘autism’ never crossed the lips of anyone around me??? My parents just let me fly free with my obsession, so much so, they took me (and my sister I guess) on a 2 day car journey all the way up to Inverness in Scotland to the WDCS hub with the potential promise of seeing a dolphin. Of course there was no dolphin to be seen when we arrived. Apparently they had spotted one that morning. I, of course, had a huge meltdown and I was allowed to buy anything I wanted from the gift shop. This was such an insane thing for my parents to do, and I respect them highly for it. It also means for the last 20 years I have been waiting to see a dolphin in the wild.

            What a build up. We took a 9am trip out knowing we’d be on the water for 4 hours. We tried to prepare with the correct drugs, knowing both of us suffer with motion sickness. But oh my god nothing could have prepared us for how wretched and sick the journey out on the boat was. I don’t really wanna be that graphic but I saw some things I did not want to see. And at one point, I was in such despair at how awful we both felt that I was dreading the next 3 hours and couldn’t possibly see how it could be worth it. Some light relief when we spotted a group of Risso Dolphins all napping in the water just bobbing up and down. Then, more dolphins. White Sided Pacific Dolphins. They treated us to riding on the bow of the boat, it felt so magical and perfect I cried. Then of course the Humpback Whales. It was kind of nerve wracking when they said that we should start to look out for signs of them. We were on such a small boat in the middle of the deep ocean and they were somewhere lurking. The whales were literally awesome. I was in awe. At one point, the marine guy started shouting that there was one under the boat and was about to surface, I was shaking it was so scary and exciting. Three whales rose up one by one right next to the boat it was incredible. Our last spot we were treated to some playful humpbacks splashing their tails around. And then it was home time. All worth it, and in the end neither me nor Dylan chundered off the side of the boat.

            And now for honesty corner. Travelling does feel like an insane thing to do. I’m having more meltdowns than I’d like or hoped for. I struggle with arriving somewhere new, then once I’ve found the beauty in it, it is time to go again. I had a day where I just wanted to go home and felt trapped by the constant change. But once I’d processed all of that difficult stuff, I felt so grateful to be doing what we’re doing and it all felt magical and worth it. I realised post meltdown that the whale trip was an excellent analogy. At the beginning I felt truly truly awful, not seeing a way out. But then we experienced something incredible, once in a lifetime, and it was all worth it, then we went home and napped for two hours. Very much like my weekly moods.

            Thank you for reading such an indulgent post. I think I have shown the two sides of travelling as a neurospicy. The pure joy of drowning in a life long special interest contrasted with drowning in the meltdowns and feeling unable to cope with the travel and the change. Thank god Dylan likes planning or I wouldn’t have got past Portland. Next stop is LA and this train is a real treat, the landscape is breathtaking. I did hear a lady behind us telling someone that she had been on this train since yesterday (!?) and she got on at Portland thinking the train arrived in LA yesterday 9pm, rather than today 9pm. I really wanna talk to her and ask if she’s ok???
