            It is day 37 of the trip and this past week feels more of a mouthful than the previous few weeks. We start the week in Oakland, our first little taste of California, the part I have been most looking forward to. Due to a dramatic start to the week, and taking inspiration from our autistic queen Fern Brady, I’ve written a bit more about my experience travelling as an autistic person who struggles with change and transition. Could be juicy, could be absolute TMI.  </p>

            When we stepped off the plane at Oakland CA airport, the air smelt warmer, the sun was brighter, pinker, more inviting. Our Oakland sit was in a small, peaceful apartment in Oakland, with a huge orange cat called Zazu. There was something about the California sky that made me feel like I was in holiday mode. It was still sweater weather but certainly a change from rainy Pacific North West. People kept warning us of the dangers of Oakland, car break ins, muggings, prolific drug use. But the side we saw of Oakland was quaint and calming. Lake Merritt is the main attraction, people walking, running, cycling, sunbathing on the grassy verges. LOTS of birds, including snowy egrets and black-crowned night herons. I saw a big white pelican through some binoculars. We went to the Saturday morning farmers’ market next to Lake Merritt. Bustling with organic fruit & veg stalls and people drinking matcha lattes. Also along Lake Merritt we went to a small Bonsai Garden the other side of the lake. It was beautiful, with big blossom trees, and some bonsais 100 years old.

            Other than that, our Oakland portion was uneventful in the tourist-y sense. The next few days were a bit of a blur as we travelled an hour to collect the keys for our next sit, came back to Oakland for the night, then trotted back over to SF for our next sit. The multiple transitions in a short space of time got me in a chokehold, it had also felt like I had finally processed that we were travelling. I let myself cry and be grumpy and have meltdowns and do very little, for what felt like days on end. Fern Brady she explains in her book how she thought that if she could gain enough stats about her meltdowns, she would eventually figure out how to stop having them. The stats did start to work in her favour, but then a flurry of meltdowns would tip the scales again. In my research reading about autistic adults’ experience of travelling there is broadly two camps of people: Camp A) no travelling, too difficult, too much change, airports are horrid; Camp B) I accept there will be meltdowns and I make time for them. With this new data in tow, we cancel our planned short sits in Southern California, making room for more stable, longer stays.

            I acknowledge that 4 days lost to meltdowns out of 37 days is great stats. After the statistical blip, SF slapped hard. The steep streets, the brightly coloured Edwardian houses, bikes, Golden Gate Park, skylines. Golden Gate Park: Nothing to do with the bridge but if you get high enough, you can see the red structure peaking out through the trees.  We are situated for over a week directly next to the east entrance of Golden Gate Park with Gizmo the dog. This park is heaven, I have been there everyday, multiple times a day. To walk the dog, go for a run, to cycle down to Ocean Beach, to go to the Japanese Tea Garden, to see the bison sanctuary. I went for a run with the dog down the main path and I felt like the main character. Despite the park’s all encompassing nature, we have done some things that have occurred outside of the park. A walk along Ocean Beach, not swimmable but lots of surfers, our first taste of the seaside. A vegan cafe nearby, Dylan had a breakfast burrito which was huge. I ordered the cheapest thing on the menu, which was a half-portion of their French toast fingers. It turned out to be a sizeable plate with maple syrup and fresh fruit, and absolutely delicious. Portions are large here but the price of food is astronomical. We did some exploring of the neighbourhood, lots of vintage shops, a goodwill (I bought another dress which will feature heavily), an astronomical amount of book shops, tie dye psychedelic shops, a famous row of houses called ‘The Painted Ladies’, views galore of the skyline.

            It’s been a full week, reflected by the length of this entry. We are staying with Gizmo the Schnoodle until the end of the week, and off to another sit in San Fran in the Mission Disctrict; reportedly a more hipster area. Well, I’m not sure how to say this. I am becoming a dog person. Despite the early mornings picking up poop, the incessant licking, the barking, I am fully sinking into my dog person era.
