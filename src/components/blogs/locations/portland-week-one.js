            It finally happened. I will set the scene. We are in a Safeway, in the capable hands of the warm customer services attendant. We are bargaining for the use of a digital coupon that allows us to buy Ben & Jerry’s for $3.49 a tub. She tells us not to worry and she will inform checkout of our need for half price Ben & Jerry’s (the vegan flavours are different here!!!!!!!), and they will input the code manually for us. So generous, as is the American way. And then it happened: “So where are you guys from?”. Hallelujah!!!! My prayers have been answered, I am interesting after all. “You guys just visiting?”. Now you are too kind.

            When we arrived in Portland after our 4 hour bus journey, we were greeted by Jon who then gave a drive-by tour of all the hot spots in Portland; including the government building that is still partly boarded up due to the race riots in 2020. Jon and Gordon took us out for dinner at a vegan Thai place, where we were joined by their friends Julia, from Canterbury (a southern English accent!!!) and David who is Australian. A triple date?? Jon wanted to tell us everything about his 100(!!) year old home while Pepe barked at us for our attention. He told that it was the original glass which I’m not sure is impressive or not. He showed us his vintage record player which turned out to be, in fact, a gramophone. After a lot of googling, I did get it to work, and I played an American Waltzes record by winding the crank as it turns out there was no ‘on’ button. Rich people buy the weirdest things. Speaking of, unlike the last house, this house does not have a sauna in the garden, but it does have a steam room in the basement! Of course!

            I started a notes app with the intention of making notes of things I found worthy of sharing. So far all it says is “Butter popcorn cinema”. When I tell you that the inside of the nasty ass rundown Regal Cinemas smelled like actual heaven. I wanted to inhale the carpets. We were there to see Run Away Dolls in the smallest, intimate cinema with our fellow Portlandians.

            Seattle is known for rain but Portland is colder and rainier. Portland still wins by being an actual nice place to be. Places are actually walkable, and there are cyclists in the wind and rain: my kind of people. On Saturday we walked only 50 mins to the open-air Saturday morning market; AND we walked home again. We really are adventurers. We are a 20 minute walk to Hawthorne Boulevard, home to Bagdad Theatre and plenty of interesting Vintage Stores. Every 5 minutes you will come across a dispensary. All the states we seem to be travelling to have legalised recreational use of weed. It is also legal to grow it, which is exactly what Gordon does in the garage. Jon told us that he only grows it as a hobbyist and doesn’t really smoke it but also the neighbours rely on him for some sort of weed balm?

            We haven’t done much touristy stuff yet, asides visiting a free art museum in a college. Climbing Mount Tabor is on the cards but the weather forecast keeps predicting snow, which it never does. I am very much in love with the dog, Pepe the Chihuahua. Not converted entirely from cats but oh to play fetch with a dog in the garden, is there anything sweeter? The spins when he is excited for a treat because he was such a good boy on his walk???? I will lay down my life for you, Pepe. Week one in Portland complete, two more to go.
