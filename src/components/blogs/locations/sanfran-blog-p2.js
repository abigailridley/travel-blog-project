            Day 49 of Big Trip. I am writing this from the minivan on the way to Monterey. Our time in San Francisco has come to an end, probably my favourite city I’ve ever had the pleasure to explore. The Mission District certainly gave a different flavour to SF that we did not get in the Golden Gate Park area. It had a big latino community, hearing people everywhere talking in Spanish got me excited to head to Mexico and start our Latin America part of the trip.

            <p>Visiting the Golden Gate Bridge was just as iconic as I imagined. We walked all the way along the waterside nearing the bridge and the views are stunning. The colour and the lines and the way the sun hits the towers, it’s really beautiful. I enjoyed reading the signs about how it was built and why it was such a revolutionary design, being the longest and tallest suspension bridge in the world at the time.

            <p>We had the pleasure of returning to the Golden Gate Park for the deYoung museum and the Conservatory of Flowers. The deYoung museum had this amazing exhibition where you could sit and write a letter to someone and if you put an address on the envelope and the museum would send it for you. The Conservatory of Flowers reminded me of the conservatory in Kew Gardens, lots of beautiful greenery in different climates. But for some reason the Americans had to add Rainforest Cafe noises in the background. There are no simple pleasures like looking at some tropical plants without hearing a monkey yapping away on the soundscape. The Castro District, the LGBTQ+ capital of San Francisco, has huge rainbow flags on every lamppost and lots of shops with innuendoes. We were told there are often nudists walking around but none of that we did see. Wednesday was the free day for their GLBT historical museum, so of course we had the go. It was a really small museum, just one room but full of information about San Francisco’s historic involvement in the fight for gay rights. 
             </p>
            <p>We finally rode the street car!!! We rode the Powell/Hyde line from one end to the other. I stood on the edge and I felt like a dog with its head sticking out the window. The guy running it would tell you when to not lean out so you don’t get your head chopped off. We hit a couple of spots like some road which is a zigzag, a tower, some nice stairs, some boba tea in China Town (which is absolutely huge), and ended the day at the SFMoMA.

            <p>The bus arrived at my destination so I am finishing this off from our sit in Monterey. It feels amazing to be in a small town by the sea. I went for a run in the sunshine this morning round the coast and the sea smell was so strong it was so good. Looking forward to some slower days and of course the WHALE WATCHING TRIP.
