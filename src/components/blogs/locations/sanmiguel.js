Sooooo right now it’s about day 130 of Big Trip. I’ve been neglecting making blog posts partly because of some strong planetary transits. So this is actually gonna be about San Miguel de Allende which we left about 3 weeks ago. 
</p>

When we arrived in San Miguel I was immediately ill, which we joked was covid but then it actually felt quite like when I covid before. Dylan mocks me but I am CONVINCED we were under attack from the altitude. I am a sensitive grl so I felt very out of breath. But, yeah, could have been covid or of course the fact it was boiling hot. Only a max of 35 celsius tho, so a little relief from the 38s of Guadalajara.

After the intensity of GDL we had the pleasure of this beautiful, rustic-y airbnb just outside the centre. It had a beautiful garden that was full of plants and a group of hummingbirds that frequented the little feeder hanging in the tree. The centre of San Miguel de Allende is full of little streets and beautiful buildings. It’s a pueblo magico so all the buildings are traditional and they preserve the historic signs and architecture. It’s really a beautiful place, and lots of retired Americans think so too. They call it Gringolandia; ie. Yankville. We chatted to a nice man at a hole in the wall food place that did Mexican style vegan burritos. He had a LOT to say about rude Canadians and Americans. Had no idea Canadians had a reputation for being rude. But he said that the main thing Mexicans say about San Miguel is that it’s a beautiful place but shame about the Americans. But Roberto ensured that people don’t think the same about people from Europe; I was flattered he considered us European.

We did venture to this like art gallery complex thing a bit outside the centre. It was a weird scene, the only Mexican people we heard/saw worked in the cafe. They have definitely created their own little gated community vibe. There’s this supermarket on the outskirts of a few cities we’ve been to called City Market - it is full of American products at eye watering prices. But sometimes you just need some fake meat slices and cocoa naked bars to feel like yourself again.

Near the end of our San Miguel stay we took a day trip to a local town called Guanajuato. Really small town with lots of beautiful buildings and winding roads. It’s famous for the panoramic view of all the colourful buildings. There’s a cable car which takes you up there which we accidentally couldn’t find and ended up walking all the way to the top. You could see approx 6 churches/cathedrals from the top of this hill on just one side. 
</p>
<p>
The final evening we went out to a slightly more fancy vegan restaurant. And I had THE best tacos of the entire trip. I cannot explain them, they were so perfect and delicious. Blue corn tortillas are my absolute favourite. Then we wondered round the streets a bit as the sun was going down. And stumbled upon some traditional Mexican performances in front of the main cathedral. The girlies in their dresses and fancy hairdos, and the guys in their suits and hats. Lots of smiling and looking into each other’s eyes. As it should be. It’s called TRADITION. 
</p>
<p>
It was kind of an uneventful 12 days, it felt good to relax and do very little. Still don’t know exactly what the rest of the trip is gonna look like but I am no longer homesick!!!! and that is a relief.
