            From Beavers to Basketball. Portland week 3 is complete. It is day 28 of the trip and we have made it to Oakland, California. So let me recap the final few days of our Portland stint. 
            </p>
                
            <p>The week started off strong with a very very rainy trip to the Crystal Springs rhododendron garden which included a beaver sighting. The way it cleaned itself as it got out the water was so bloody charming and cute. There were no rhododendrons but plenty of MOSS. I have grown an affinity with moss. I heard on my fave podcast that some moss has leaves that are only one cell thick. Wow, Moss, you are so interesting. The next day started on a high as I finished my 1000pc house plant puzzle. We headed for lunch at one of the many food truck locations across the city. Both choosing the vegan poutine as Potato Champion. No idea if this is accurate poutine but it was delightfully beige food. Next stop, Washington Park, where we were blessed by a wonderful walk through some huge redwood trees. The fauna and flora was really <i>giving</i>. More beige vegan food included a trip to Boxcar Pizza which absolutely blew my mind. So cheesy and delightful, with thick thick crust and high sides that go all chewy. Just wow.

            <p>For our final night in Portland we bought cheap tickets to see a basketball game, our seats were so high up I see why they call it the nosebleeds. Portland Trail Blazers vs New York Knicks. I can’t tell you much about the sport itself but the stadium was absolute sensory overload as soon as you walk through the door. From intense bag checks that go on for way too long, to loud music, smells of pizza and popcorn and fries, people rushing around in their Portland Trail Blazers merch, staff trying to get you to buy raffle tickets, and the worst of all: a pint for $14.50??? That tipped me over the edge. This place was a real juicy morsel of American culture; cheerleaders AND the national anthem? Yes please. Rather than the stadium going quiet for the penalties, the crowd was actively encouraged to make noise while the opponent was making their penalty shots. Bizarre. Kiss cam but without any actual kiss cam, just ‘air guitar cam’, not as great. And ‘Lion King cam’ which ended up people holding their babies in the air which was so bloody cute in their little ear defenders all sleeping and stuff. Some chants included ‘Let’s go, Blazers’ and ‘Defense’ and some dude shouting ‘Dude’ from all the way in the back as Portland sorely lost.

            <p>Friday we departed from Portland, on, cruelly, the sunniest day of the whole trip. We said our goodbyes to Pepe whom we had grown to love in his little feral way. Jon ever so kindly drove us to the airport to depart from Oregon and get our butts to California, baby. I will tell you right now that for some reason we both got bumped up to premium and I took advantage of the free alcohol and had an alarmingly strong margarita, with more leg room than I knew what to do with. On arrival at Oakland airport we had more strange interactions where bus drivers refuse to take our money and let us on for free. On our second bus, I literally handed the guy a $5 bill and he just said “you hold onto that”?? The air smells different here, the sun is warmer in temp AND hue, succulents fill the gardens, palm trees dot the skyline. Just 4 days in Oakland, with a sweet cat called Zazu. A big beefy orange one.
