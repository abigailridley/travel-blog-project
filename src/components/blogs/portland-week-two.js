            It has been 23 days of travel as I write this.

            We saw eagles. EAGLES. In the trees. Eagles. EEEeEeEee-gullsssssss. White heads, yellow feet, very weird noise. They were up in the trees at Mount Tabor park, which is an ‘extinct volcanic vent’, just looks like a big hill though. The locals were very excited and thought they might be babies. 
A strong start to the week, difficult to top. We had a somewhat failed trip to a wildlife reserve, where we got lost and walked with a bunch of dogs along a small beach.

            The next day, we followed that up by a trip to Powell’s, a huge book shop. The friendliness of Americans is truly unmatched. What is a trip to the book shop without a museum trip on the free day of the month? We headed to Portland Art Museum, for their Black Artists of Oregon exhibition. A really beautiful collection, though some of the people in there were very rude and weird and uncomfy.

            At the weekends there are more people around milling about the shops. We went to Division St which has lots of little vintage stores and cute shops with trinkets and plants. One of them had a very sweet black lab wearing a scarf. I bought a vintage fruity dress which I love and Dylan finds hideous. It’ll start to feature once we finally travel further south and get some sun!!!

            That’s all for now; our final few days in Portland promise some exciting ventures including a basketball game. And potentially billiards.
